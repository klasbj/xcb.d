xcb.d is bindings D bindings for the XCB library.

It is based on what is on dsource.org:
  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xcb/2007-August/002977.html
and XML files from xcb-proto 1.10. The XML files are slightly modified
to pass through the generator script (mostly xkb.xml). Some parts will likely
not work.
